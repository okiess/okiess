### Oliver's Github Profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is Oliver Kiessler and I am a freelance fullstack developer from Cologne, Germany. I specialize in web applications (Angular, Ruby on Rails) and API backend solutions (NodeJS, AWS Lambda & Amplify, Serverless Framework, Java).

As an experienced fullstack software developer and IT consultant, I independently take on projects/assignments on a freelance basis or support your company as part of your team.
